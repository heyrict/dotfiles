menu_up     k Up
menu_select space Return
#menu_open m

# Same for image navigation ...
next_img n Right
prev_img p Left

# and image movement
#scroll_up    J C-Up
#scroll_down  K C-Down
#scroll_left  H C-Left
#scroll_right L C-Right
scroll_up    k

# remove now conflicts with toggle_filenames, so change that
toggle_filenames F

# zooming
zoom_in  C-Up f
zoom_out C-Down a
zoom_default d
zoom_fit s

# I only hit these accidentaly
save_image
